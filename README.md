# üí¨ TextWhitelist - The Ultimate Whitelist Management Tool

Tired of managing a cumbersome `whitelist.json` file or complex whitelist plugins? **TextWhitelist** is a powerful, yet lightweight plugin designed for server administrators who prefer simple, text-file-based management combined with a full suite of in-game commands.

Built for wide compatibility (**1.8 - 1.21+**), it's the perfect solution for offline-mode servers or any community that needs to quickly and dynamically manage player access without ever needing a server restart for list updates.

## ‚ú® Core Features

-   **Full In-Game Command Suite:** Control every aspect of the plugin without ever touching a file. Add, remove, change modes, reload, and get help directly in-game.
-   **Dual Whitelist System:**
    -   **`players.txt`:** Manage your general player base.
    -   **`admins.txt`:** Manage staff who can join even during maintenance mode.
-   **Intelligent Maintenance Mode:** With `/wltxt change admins`, you can instantly lock down your server for staff-only access. The plugin will even kick online players who are not on the admin list with a proper "maintenance" message.
-   **Interactive & Paginated Player Lists:** Use `/wltxt list` to view whitelisted players in a clean, paginated format with clickable `[Remove]` and page navigation buttons directly in chat!
-   **Master On/Off Switch:** Globally enable or disable the entire plugin on the fly with `/wltxt enable|disable`. This setting is saved in your `config.yml`.
-   **Smart List Sanitization:** The plugin is smart! When you add a user to the admin list, it automatically removes them from the player list to prevent redundancies.
-   **Wide Version Compatibility:** Built to run on most Spigot-based servers from version 1.8 all the way to 1.21 and newer.
-   **Robust & Compatible:** Uses the highest event priority to ensure its rules are final and not bypassed by other plugins like AuthMe.
